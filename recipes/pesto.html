        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Today we will learn how to make basil pesto pasta. This recipe is from Not Another Cooking 
            Show on YouTube. It is inspired by Massimo Botturo's pesto recipe.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Lbs pasta of your choice</li>
            <li>2 Bunches of Fresh Basil (10 oz)</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup of Grated Parmigiano Reggiano</li>
            <li>1-2 Cloves of Garlic</li>
            <li>2-3 Tbsps of Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
            <li>1/3 Cup of Pine Nuts</li>
            <li>A couple of Ice Cubes</li>
            <li>Pasta water as needed</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
       
        <h3>Optional Add-Ins</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 Cup Cherry Tomatoes, Diced</li>
            <li>Toasted Breadcrumbs</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Toast the pine nuts in a dry pan over medium heat. Toss them around to allow them to 
                toast evenly. Take them out of the pan once they start to brown and set them aside.
                </li>
            <li>Add the basil leaves, grated parmesan, garlic, olive oil, ice cubes, and salt to a blender
                and blend well. We add ice cubes because it helps prevent oxidization and keeps the pesto 
                bright green. Once that is all blended, add in your toasted pine nuts and blend again. Add water 
                and oil to adjust the consistency of the pesto to your liking.
            </li>
            <li>Now we make the pasta. Get a pot of water to a boil and add some salt. Throw in about a pound of 
                pasta and cook until it is al dente.
            </li>
            <li>Once the pasta is cooked, save some of the pasta water and drain the pasta. Into a big bowl, add 
                the drained pasta and 2 cups of the pesto. Mix the pasta until it is evenly coated with the pesto. 
                Add some pasta water to help create a smooth consistency. Then add any additional ingredients you want 
                such as cherry tomatoes or breadcrumbs and give it another toss. Now it is ready to be enjoyed.
