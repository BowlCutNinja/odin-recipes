        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This popcorn chicken recipe comes from Sue Li. </p>
        <p>Servings: 4-6</p>
        <p>Time: 30 minutes cooking, 1 hour marinating</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Chinese five-spice powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>6 cups vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Sichuan peppercorns or whole black peppercorns</li>
            <li>1 cup/115 grams tapioca flour</li>
            <li>1 cup fresh basil leaves</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, season chicken thighs with soy sauce, sugar, five-spice powder, white pepper and 
                salt. Set aside to marinate for about 1 hour at room temperature, or refrigerate overnight.
            </li>
            <li>Get a medium sized pot and heat vegetable oil over medium heat to 350 degrees. Coarsely grind 
                the peppercorns and mix with the remaining 2 teaspoons of kosher salt. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Toss the marinated chicken with tapioca flour and about 1 tablespoon of water until the tapioca flour 
                looks like small beads and clings to the chicken. This will give the chicken a very crunchy crust.
            </li>
            <li>Add the chicken to the hot oil and fry until golden brown, 5-7 minutes. Once chicken is done cooking, 
                transfer to a wire rack or paper towel-lined plate and season with the peppercorn mixture.
            </li>
            <li>Fry the basil leaves until translucent, 1 to 2 minutes, and scatter them over the fried chicken.</li>
        </ol>
