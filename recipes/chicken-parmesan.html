        <h4>for the Chicken Parmesan</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>6 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>8 ounces panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>2 large boneless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>tomato sauce</li>

        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        
        <h4>Tomato Sauce</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Get a pan and heat up some olive oil (enough to cover the entire pan).</li>
            <li>Thinly slice your garlic and add them to the pan. Fry them until they turn golden brown.</li>
            <li>Add some calabrian chiles and a handful of fresh basil into the pan.</li>
            <li>Open a can of San Marzano tomatoes and puree them using a food mill or food processor. Then pour it 
                into your pan and add some salt. Let it come to a simmer and let it cook for a couple of minutes. Stir 
                occasionally. 
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Chicken Parmesan</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the beaten eggs into one dish and panko into another.</li>
            <li>Set a rack on a baking sheet and preheat your broiler.</li>
            <li>Butterfly your chicken breast and pound it as thin as you can.</li>
            <li>Dip the chicken cutlets into the egg, then into the panko. Press the chicken down hard so the panko 
                breaks and completely covers the chicken. Let the chicken sit for about 15 mins.
            </li>
            <li>Get a pan and heat up about 1 inch of olive oil over medium heat. Fry your cutlets one at a time. Let 
                them fry until they are golden brown. Then flip over and let the other side brown.
            </li>
            <li>While your chicken is cooking, spread the bottom of a large baking sheet with a smear of sauce. Once 
                the chicken is done cooking, place the on the sauce and add more sauce on top. Top the cutlets with slices 
                of cheese.
            </li>
            <li>Throw your cutlets into the broiler and broil them until the cheese is well-browned and bubbling.</li>
        </ol>
